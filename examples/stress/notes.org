* Questions
- [ ] Fix zero mid for second regression?
- [ ] Use all lag times or only after expected direct arrival?
- [ ] Always regress causal/acausal together?
- [ ] Determining best window size?

* Implentation
- From testing, measuring lag from cross-correlation much more robust than mwcs. Subsample resolution achieved by interpolating ifft


* Stress change (info from gerrits paper)

- coda will decay exponentially up to ~0.5 seconds lag time

- In this lag time travel time delays will range from 0 to 2.5e-4 seconds

- These changes are less than the sample spacing so phase shift measurements need to be made in frequency domain via linear regression of unwrapped cross-spectrum phase

- expect to make measurements in band 100-240 Hz

- Hope to measure changes on the order of 0.01% dv/v

- 10 second sections, whitened between 20-240 Hz and one-bit normalised

- Coda stable after 1 hour (i.e monitoring time resolution of 1 hour)

- To approximate the values of the velocity change between sensors we used a 3D triangulation-based linear interpolation method.
